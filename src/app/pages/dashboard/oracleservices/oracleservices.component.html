      <h1>Oracle Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)</h1>
      <p>
        Oracle Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) cloud offering allows customers to
        develop, run and manage web applications without the complexity of
        building and maintaining the infrastructure typically associated with
        developing and launching an application. If a SaaS customer wanted to
        add a business-specific feature, they would have to request this feature
        from the vendor and hope enough other customers request it too
        convincing the vendor to build it. With PaaS, they can now build it
        themselves. If a customer wants functionality not available in their HCM
        core product, for example, a solution to support an ‘employee of the
        month’ program, PaaS functionality would allow that customer to build
        that new capability and clip it onto the SaaS. Customers can now replace
        the customizations they use to build into their on premise systems with
        a combination of configuration through SaaS and extensibility through
        PaaS. Customers can get the financial advantages of subscription-based
        pricing, reduced IT overhead, built-in process best practices, and
        faster access to new features and functions associated with SaaS
        software, while still being able build-out applications to suit their
        unique requirements using PaaS.
